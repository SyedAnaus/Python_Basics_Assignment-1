    "I will be explaining and describing 3 of the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "'str'. The 'str' data type is used to tell the string data type in python. Python recognises a string if\n",
    "the characters are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. Data of the data\n",
    "type string are itertable, and can be used to display text on the console. There are many use cases for the\n",
    "string data type, but the most common one is: To handle textual data. But what is a string? Strings in\n",
    "python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. Those characters can be anything for integers to\n",
    "symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "'int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length in python.\n",
    "They are immutable data types, meaning that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly\n",
    "allocated object. They are used to preform  various arithmetic operations, like addition, subtraction,\n",
    "multiplication, and division as well as data manipulation, slicing data, modifying data, and iteration of\n",
    "data...etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python boolean type represents one of two values: True or False. Generally, being used to represent the\n",
    "truth values of the expression. For example, 5==5 is True whereas 2<1 is False. We can evaluate values and\n",
    "variables using the Python bool() function. This method is used to return or convert a value to a\n",
    "Boolean value. There isn't much to the boolean data type other than evaluating values, but, is used more\n",
    "often than not."
